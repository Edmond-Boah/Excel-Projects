## Recommendations  

- **Target Morning Sales**: Since most purchases occur in the morning, allocate more staff and marketing efforts to the 7–10 a.m. window to reduce wait times and boost sales.  
- **Store Performance**: All three locations perform well in orders, units sold, and revenue; continue to monitor for location-specific opportunities.  
- **Focus on Top Product**: Sustainably Grown Coffee should be promoted further (bundles, loyalty discounts, etc.) to maximize its strong revenue contribution.  

## Conclusion  

The dashboard equips decision-makers with a clear view of sales performance across products, times of day, and store locations.  
By acting on the insights—especially targeting morning demand and leveraging the popularity of Sustainably Grown Coffee—the coffee shop can enhance customer experience, optimize staffing, and increase revenue across all three stores.
